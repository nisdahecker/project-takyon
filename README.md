# project-takyon
Project: TAKYON is a 2D platform fighter inspired by the Global Fisting League, a fictional fighting organization ran by Halley Lab's Eugene Takyon, and the wrestling entertainment industry, currently solely in development by Telegram@nisbellecoeur. The goal is to make a frenetic fighter where an upset is around each corner and no match is over until it's over. The controls will be like Smash Bro's, with mechanics inspired by the drama and action that viewers crave.
